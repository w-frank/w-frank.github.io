Title: About

My name is Will. I'm an engineer and designer currently
living in beautiful Cumbria, UK. My technical interests span embedded systems, 
digital signal processing, and control systems, particularly in the fields of 
audio, energy systems, and agricultural technology.

I have a background in embedded systems and the research and development of 
scientific data acquisition and control systems, primarily for use on particle 
accelerators.

This site is for me to share what I've learnt on the [blog](https://www.willfrank.co.uk/),
and archive various projects in my [portfolio](https://willfrank.co.uk/pages/portfolio.html).

I have a range of experience across both analogue and digtial electronics
design and software development:

**Hardware design:**

Requirements capture, system-level design, component selection, prototyping, 
analogue and digital electronics, circuit simulation (SPICE), microcontrollers
(Atmel/Microchip AVR/PIC, STM32, Espressif ESP8266/ESP32), FPGAs & SoCs 
(Microchip, Lattice, Xilinx).

CAD for electronics panels and enclosures using AutoCAD.

**PCB Design:**

Schematic capture, PCB layout and routing. Multi-layer, mixed-signal, high-speed
PCBs. Using Cadence OrCAD or KiCad.

**Firmware and software development:**

Skilled in C, C++, and Python. Experienced with Arduino, ESP8266/ESP32,
Raspberry Pi and STM32 ecosystems. Basic system administration on Linux.

**Technical documentation:**

Product brochures, websites, and other marketing.

User, installation, and maintenance guides, manuals, tutorials.

Requirements and specifications, design documents, test procedures.

Project budgets and schedules.
